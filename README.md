This project is to show cases my skills so far a full stack developer. 
It is a site to for fans, and potential new fans, of The Monkees.
I built it based on the bootstrap frame work with code I had prevoiusly written. 
I used different media players for the audio and video that are build in to HTML5.
I used some hover animations to make the website feel a little more alive and interactive.
I changed some of the code that I based this off by changing the speed of some animations 
and colours as the palette for this site desired something a little different.
Some of this code is based off the previous videos that we used in lessons.
